lockscreen
==========

This is a small project I wrote for fun in April, 2013.
It locks keyboard and mouse input until a specific passphrase is generated.
Right now it is dynamically detected using the system time, but could be modified
to take a static phrase or other form of authentication, perhaps involving
the mouse or button clicks. It currently only works under the X Server, but
will be modified for Windows as well.
